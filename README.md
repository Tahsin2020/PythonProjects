Personal Python Projects

This is a respository with personal python projects I am working on.

1) Random_timer.py in Porgramming Extensions: A timer that beeps randomly with approximately a few minutes, where you close your eyes for a minute to rest them, and then open them up again when it beeps after 10 seconds from the previous beep. It repeats this until 30 beeps have beep triggered. Take a look at the code.
