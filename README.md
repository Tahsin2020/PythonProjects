Personal Python Projects

This is a respository with personal python projects I am working on.

1) Random_timer.py in Porgramming Extensions: A timer that beeps randomly with approximately a few minutes, where you close your eyes for a minute to rest them, and then open them up again when it beeps after 10 seconds from the previous beep. It repeats this until 30 beeps have beep triggered. Take a look at the code.
2) 3 Different Python Programs for Youtube Video Analyzing in Youtube Video Analyzer:

2.1) Youtuber_Downloader.py program for downloading Youtube videos where you insert the links into an array, takes 11 minutes for 1 hour 20 minute videos, 6 minutes for 30 minutes video approximately.

2.2) Hextoimage.py program to convert a file with hex numbers into an image.

2.3) Text Finder.py program which I am developing to search for colors in a video and identify if it is a reading segment or action segement.
